# Desert Code Camp, Oct 2018

(This was the screen I had up as people were assembling in room IRM 221. Added the address and ABI for the deployed contract on the Ethereum mainnet for you to interact with.)

Hi. I'm Michael Rice.

------------------------------

## What We'll Do This Afternoon
1. TDD a Solidity contract
2. Deploy it on a test blockchain (Rinkeby) using Pragma
3. Create a small React app (create-react-app + rsync)
4. Commit to Github and you can add your names (let's cap it at 29)

------------------------------

Deployed contract on mainnet

Address: `0x27b085eda7b00e755f81f9561bb605a3df753691`
ABI:
`[{"constant":false,"inputs":[{"name":"name","type":"string"}],"name":"wasHere","outputs":[],"payable":false,"stateMutability":"nonpayable","type":"function"},{"constant":true,"inputs":[{"name":"","type":"uint256"}],"name":"attendees","outputs":[{"name":"","type":"string"}],"payable":false,"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"},{"constant":true,"inputs":[],"name":"howManyWereHere","outputs":[{"name":"","type":"uint256"}],"payable":false,"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"}]`

Add your name using wasHere() !! 

You can [use Pragma too](https://www.withpragma.com/share/R3uS44DJRUT9)
